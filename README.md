This practice app is intended to closely resemble pinterest.com (which it does, I think!), although I didn't try to mimic the aesthetics 100%.

It uses paperclip and Amazon S3 for image uploads, jquery for the tiling, and Devise for authentication.

There are still a few tweaks here and there that I may get round to implenting (such as Devise mailers, for example), but I'm concentrating mainly on other things now.

See the app online [here](http://aspinteresting.com). If you signed-up and added some pins, that would be make me a very happy man indeed!
